# Governance

## Project: OPEN AUTH

This document defines the governance model for **OPEN AUTH**, an open-source authentication framework designed as a reference implementation and foundation for SaaS platforms, eCommerce systems, and APIs.

The goal of this governance is to ensure **clarity, transparency, security, and long-term sustainability** while keeping decision-making efficient and aligned with the project’s vision.

## 1. Project Leadership

### Maintainer

The project is currently maintained by:

- **James Córdoba** (Project Founder & Lead Maintainer)
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/Stiven-21](https://github.com/Stiven-21)

The maintainer is responsible for:

- Defining the technical vision and roadmap
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases and versioning
- Handling security disclosures
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct
- Acting as final decision authority when consensus cannot be reached

## 2. Decision-Making Process

OPEN AUTH follows a **maintainer-led governance model**.

### General Principles

- Decisions should be made **in the open** (GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions).
- Technical discussions should be respectful, documented, and reproducible.
- Preference is given to solutions that prioritize:
  - Security
  - Backward compatibility
  - Clarity and maintainability
  - Real-world SaaS and API use cases

### Consensus

- Contributors are encouraged to discuss and propose changes.
- When consensus is reached, the maintainer approves and merges.
- If consensus cannot be reached, the maintainer makes the final decision.

## 4. Security Governance

Given the nature of authentication and identity management, **security is a top priority**.

---
