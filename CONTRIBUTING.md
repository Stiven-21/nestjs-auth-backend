## 🧭 Contribution Philosophy

OPEN AUTH is built on the following principles:

- Clarity over complexity
- Security by default
- Readable and maintainable code
- Modular architecture
- Well-documented decisions

If a contribution does not improve at least one of these points, it will likely need adjustments.

Example:

```

```
